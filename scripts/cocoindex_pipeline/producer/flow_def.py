"""The FULL producer flow, composed as ONE entry point — ID-132 {132.23}
G-FLOWDEF, the Task's own defining "2-pass producer" deliverable, extended by
{132.27} G-FLOW-STAGING-WIRE with the STAGING + BI-28 provenance composition.

This module is the single place the already-landed producer pieces are
composed into one runnable chain (the `producer` command entry point):

    LRecordsSource.list_concepts()                 # {132.4} G-SOURCE
      -> enrich_concept(key, source)               # {132.8} G-PASS1  (mount_each grain)
      -> [run_web_pass(...) if gated_corpus]       # {132.9} G-PASS2  (optional)
      -> write_bundle(bundle_dir, drafts, ...)     # {132.10} G-BUNDLE
      -> declare_concept_embedding(re_target)      # {132.11} G-EMBED
      -> git_sync.reapply_overrides(...)           # {132.24}/{132.27} BI-27 fold-in
      -> git_sync.sync_bundle(..., stage_only=True) # {132.24}/{132.27} G-GITSYNC STAGING

Until {132.23} nothing in the codebase actually ran this chain end-to-end —
`bundle_writer.py`'s docstring named {132.13} as the owner, {132.13}
(`publish.py`) disclaimed it to the parent Task, and `trigger.py`'s
`default_producer_entry_point` was a Pass-1-only stand-in ({132.16}). {132.23}
closed that gap; `default_producer_entry_point` now delegates here.

**Collection safety (mirrors `trigger.py`).** This module must NOT import
`cocoindex` — nor any producer module that transitively does
(`producer/enrich.py`, `producer/web_pass.py`, `producer/bundle_writer.py`,
`producer/embed.py`, `scripts/cocoindex_pipeline/flow.py`) — at MODULE
scope, so `trigger.py` can import it and the dispatch-logic unit tests stay
importable with no cocoindex stub. Every such symbol is imported LAZILY,
inside `run_producer_flow`'s own body, only when a configured run actually
reaches that stage. The composed `enrich_concept` is `@coco.fn`-decorated —
it is invoked DIRECTLY as a plain awaitable (never re-wrapped / re-decorated),
exactly as {132.16}'s stand-in already did.

**Idle-mode safety (preserved from {132.16}).** `run_producer_flow` no-ops
(returns `None`) whenever `bundle_dir`/`OKF_BUNDLE_DIR` is unset or missing,
or no `pool` is supplied — true in every environment today, so wiring this
into `app_main` spends no Anthropic/OpenAI tokens and touches no filesystem
or git repo until an operator deliberately configures the bundle location.
Each downstream stage degrades independently through its own injection seam:
no `re_target` -> no embedding write (mirrors `flow._declare_record_embedding`'s
guard); no `repo_path` -> no git staging; no `gated_corpus` -> Pass-2 skipped.

**Owner ruling (S456, {132.23}): a log.md-only diff is a no-op — no repo
mutation at all.** `bundle_writer.append_log_entry` stamps a freshly-
timestamped `## <ISO-8601>` block into `log.md` on EVERY run (BI-11's
unconditional log stamp), so a run where every concept file is byte-identical
to the last publish would still present a changed `log.md` to
`git_sync.sync_bundle`. This module encodes the owner ruling at the
COMPOSITION layer — the only layer inside this Subtask's file-ownership
boundary (`git_sync.py`/`publish.py` are out of scope): when `write_bundle`'s
`RunSummary.is_no_op` is True (no concept-level add/change/remove/move/
finding), the ONLY diff is the new `log.md` stamp, so the staging step is
SKIPPED entirely. The BI-11 stamp still lands in the bundle working tree and
is carried into the NEXT real run; it just never stages a spurious diff of
its own.

**STAGING, not a per-run commit (S436 amendment BI-27/DR-016; {132.27}
G-FLOW-STAGING-WIRE).** Per PRODUCT.md's S436 amendment, "runs land in a
STAGING state; the one-commit-per-run publish happens after the review/
publish gate." This module calls `git_sync.sync_bundle(..., stage_only=True)`
DIRECTLY for the per-run reconcile (apply + `git add`, no commit) —
superseding the {132.23}-era `publish.publish_bundle` call (BI-21 hard gate +
immediate commit). The BI-21 HARD GATE and the actual one-time commit now
live SOLELY in `producer/publish.py`'s own `publish_bundle`/`producer
publish` CLI — a SEPARATE, human-triggered action run after the accept/edit/
reject review, never chained automatically from this per-run flow.
`status_source`/`_default_status_source` (the {132.13}-era BI-21 injection
seam) are accordingly REMOVED from this module — BI-21 gating is entirely
`publish.py`'s concern now.

Two more pieces wire in at this same seam:

- **`overrides` (BI-27, DR-016).** Approved `git_sync.ProducerOverride`s,
  folded onto this run's bundle output via `git_sync.reapply_overrides`
  BEFORE it is staged into the client-owned repo — an approved human edit is
  never dropped by a fresh regeneration. Defaults to `()`; PERSISTING which
  overrides are "approved" across runs is a separate, not-yet-built concern
  (the follow-on accept/edit/reject review surface, DR-013 shape) — this
  seam accepts whatever the caller supplies, exactly like every other
  injection seam in this module.
- **BI-28 provenance map ({132.21}/{132.22}).** `git_sync.sync_bundle`'s
  `source_workspace_ids` — a `concept_path -> workspace_id` map — is built
  HERE from every won-bid `case_study` `ConceptKey.workspace_id` this run's
  `list_concepts()` enumerated, so a won-bid entry in the emitted
  `proposed_change_set` carries its `source_workspace_id` (BI-28: "never an
  automatic bundle write ... gated by human accept/edit/reject review").

**Physical-vs-identity key reconciliation (ID-132 {132.29} fix-forward).**
`write_bundle`'s `RunSummary.added`/`.changed` report the PHYSICAL bundle
write path (`bundle_writer.bundle_write_path`) — which redirects a won-bid
`case_study` draft into a `case-studies/won-bid/<slug>.md` sibling
directory, distinct from its identity `rel_path` (`ConceptKey.rel_path`,
BI-2/DR-016). Both the G-EMBED lookup below and the BI-28 provenance map
key on that SAME physical path (via `bundle_write_path`/`bundle_write_
path_for_key`) — never the identity `rel_path` — so a won-bid entry
resolves correctly instead of silently missing (the {132.29} checker-FAIL
this fixes): identity-keyed lookups against a physical-path-keyed summary
always miss for a redirected concept, and in the cross-grain same-slug
collision case (a named-client and a won-bid `case_study` sharing one
identity `rel_path`) an identity-keyed embed lookup can additionally
resolve to the WRONG draft's body.

    prior run; a no-op run embeds nothing). Embeds the distilled `body` (stable
    across runs when the backing records are unchanged — the frontmatter's
    per-run timestamp is deliberately excluded).

    `drafts_by_write_path`/`changed_write_paths` are keyed by the PHYSICAL

    keeps them distinct, mirroring how they are already kept distinct
    on-disk.

    A `changed_write_paths` entry with no matching draft is an internal
