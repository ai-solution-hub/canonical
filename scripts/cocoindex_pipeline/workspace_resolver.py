"""Folder→workspace manifest schema + resolver (PRODUCT Inv-4 / Inv-5).

The cocoindex corpus-ingest flow (TECH §2.1) reads a single JSON manifest at
the root of the ingest source folder
(`<COCOINDEX_SOURCE_PATH>/.kh-workspace-map.json`) once at flow start. This
module owns the manifest's Pydantic schema and the deterministic
folder→workspace resolution function that drives the content/qa_sidecar fork
(ID-136 retires the historical forms route this module also used to serve).

Public API:

- `RouteKind` — `Literal["content", "qa_sidecar"]` route discriminator
  (ID-80.6, 80.2 §B.2: the manifest per-prefix route tag IS the fork point —
  RATIFIED OQ-80.2-B; ID-59 {59.26} adds the `"qa_sidecar"` route for the
  frozen `__qa__/` reserved prefix). ID-136 retires the `"forms"` route —
  forms enter the system via manual upload (app-side), not the corpus walk.
- `WorkspaceMapping` — one `{path_prefix, workspace_id, route}` entry
  (`route` defaults to `"content"` — existing manifests parse unchanged).
- `WorkspaceManifest` — versioned container of mappings.
- `Resolution` — frozen `{workspace_id, route}` pair returned by
  `resolve_route`.
- `ManifestLoadError` — raised on missing / unparseable / schema-invalid
  manifest; the flow aborts at start (TECH §2.1).
- `ResolutionFailure` — base class for unmapped / ambiguous `rel_path`.
- `UnmappedPath` — `ResolutionFailure` subclass: no manifest prefix
  matches `rel_path`. OBSERVABILITY-ONLY for localfs file content — the
  workspace-agnostic canonical content already wrote (ID-69 BI-1), so the
  flow soft-warns and continues (bl-219). Not a `cocoindex.stage_error`.
- `AmbiguousResolution` — `ResolutionFailure` subclass: two or more
  equal-length manifest prefixes tie. A genuine manifest mis-wire — the
  flow surfaces it as a loud structured stage error (Inv-5: never silent
  default / sentinel).
- `load_workspace_manifest(path)` — parse + validate manifest file.
- `resolve_route(manifest, rel_path)` — longest-prefix-wins resolution
  returning BOTH the owning workspace and its route (the fork entry point).
- `resolve_workspace(manifest, rel_path)` — thin shim over `resolve_route`
  returning only the workspace UUID (kept for existing callers).

Workspace UUIDs are NOT verified against the live `workspaces` table at
load time — FK enforcement at INSERT time surfaces stale UUIDs canonically
(TECH §2.1).

# Route discriminator (ID-80.6, 80.2 §B.2 — RATIFIED OQ-80.2-B): the manifest
# per-prefix `route` tag is the content / Q&A-sidecar fork point. `Literal` +
# `extra="forbid"` make any typo a load-time `ValidationError` →
# `ManifestLoadError` at the manifest-load gate (loud abort at flow start).
#
# ID-59 {59.26} (TECH-qa-sidecar P1): `"qa_sidecar"` is the second route — a
# manifest mapping `{path_prefix: "__qa__/", route: "qa_sidecar"}` routes a
# reserved-prefix Q&A sidecar to the sidecar branch (source_documents + the
# q_a_extractions tier ONLY; ZERO content rows — PRODUCT INV-5). The `__qa__/`
# prefix string is FROZEN against this route (ID-45 {45.3} freezes it).
# `resolve_route` needs NO change: it returns `winner.route` verbatim, so a
# `"qa_sidecar"` mapping forks by longest-prefix exactly like any other route.
#
# ID-136 (DR-014): the historical third route, `"forms"` (Path-B blank-form
# corpus ingestion), is RETIRED — forms enter the system via app-side manual
# upload (`app/api/procurement/[id]/forms/route.ts`), never the corpus walk.
# The Literal narrows accordingly; any manifest still tagging a prefix
# `route:"forms"` now fails LOUDLY at load time (`ManifestLoadError`), which is
# the intended behaviour — there is no silent fallback.
