# ast-dataflow — Skill catalogue

## What ast-dataflow is

ast-dataflow is a type-checker-resolved static analysis library for the
Knowledge Hub TypeScript codebase. It wraps `ts-morph` (the TypeScript
compiler API) and exposes fifteen queries as a CLI, as a programmatic
module, and as a warm MCP server. Unlike `grep` or text search, every query
resolves symbols through TypeScript's type system — aliases, re-exports, and
indirect references are all tracked.

**Primary CLI:**

```bash
bun run ast-dataflow <query> [args]
```

**Warm MCP server** (id-375): `bun run ast-dataflow-mcp` starts a stdio
server exposing one dispatching `ast_dataflow` tool (plus `corpus_info`)
over a long-lived ts-morph Project — first call pays the ~6 s project load,
subsequent calls run in ~100-200 ms with a per-call staleness sweep
(`meta.refreshedFiles` etc.). Not registered in `.mcp.json` — registration
happens at the extraction phase, when canonical installs the tool as an end
user would (PRODUCT.md A3 rider); the CLI stays the always-available cold
path.

## When to use ast-dataflow vs. sibling tools

| Tool | Use when |
|---|---|
| **ast-dataflow** | You need file-and-line resolution with TypeScript semantic precision: exact call sites, type-position references, column access sites, or string-literal AST context |
| **gitnexus** | You need process-level blast radius, execution-flow orientation, or automated rename — but do NOT need full indirect-caller enumeration |
| **Knip** | You need entry-point reachability (binary yes/no: dead vs. reachable) — but NOT semantic confirmation of why |
| **ccc** | You need concept-based file discovery across all corpus types (TS, Python, SQL, Markdown) — but NOT AST precision |

ast-dataflow and gitnexus are **complementary, not competing.** Use them
together — see the Cross-tool patterns section below.

---

## Query catalogue

Fifteen queries are available. Match your question to the right query:

### callers — "who calls this function?"

```bash
bun run ast-dataflow callers \
  --symbol 'lib/supabase/safe.ts:sb'
```

Returns every call site of a function, including indirect callers (arrow-
function callbacks, Promise.all wrappers, HOC patterns) that gitnexus may
not index. Each row carries: `file`, `line`, `column`, `enclosing` (the
function/method that wraps the call), `resolution` (`direct` | `aliased` |
`indirect`).

**Use when:** debugging a wrong-argument bug, verifying a contract
(e.g. UUID shape), or confirming every caller before modifying a function.
**Companion skill:** `ast-dataflow-call-chain-pin` (Pattern 5).

---

### callees — "what does this function call?"

```bash
bun run ast-dataflow callees \
  --symbol 'lib/supabase/safe.ts:sb'
```

The inverse of `callers`: every call made from inside the named function's
body, resolved through the type checker. External (node_modules) callees are
excluded by default with a top-level `externalCount`; `--include-external`
emits them with `callee.file: null` (never a node_modules path). Error kind
`not_callable` when the symbol is not a function.

**Use when:** understanding a function before refactoring it, auditing what
a route handler touches, building a mental call graph downward.

---

### references — "every TypeScript reference to a symbol"

```bash
bun run ast-dataflow references \
  --symbol 'types/bid.ts:BidState'
```

Returns all references classified by kind: `read`, `write`, `typeReference`,
`typeOnly`, `jsxComponent`, `reexport`. Confidence is always `exact` (type-
checker resolved). Useful for pre-rename impact and for confirming a rename
swept all sites.

**Use when:** pre-rename reference count, post-rename verification, type-
evolution blast radius.

---

### importers — "which files import this module?"

```bash
bun run ast-dataflow importers \
  --module '@/lib/supabase/safe'
```

Returns all files that import the given module path, including named import
details (`namedImports`, `importStyle`). After a rename, the old module path
should return `error.kind === 'unknown_file'` (the module is gone). Any
results means missed imports.

**Use when:** post-rename import-path sweep, confirming no barrel-chain gaps,
checking who depends on a module before removing it.

---

### string-literal-uses — "find string literals with AST context"

```bash
bun run ast-dataflow string-literal-uses \
  --value 'generateDigest'
```

Finds every string literal matching the value and classifies its AST
context: `viMock` (Vitest `vi.mock(...)` argument), `jsxProp` (JSX
attribute value), `sqlTag` (SQL tagged template), `envKey`
(`process.env[...]` key), `argument` (other call-expression argument).
Python and SQL files outside the ts-morph corpus are NOT covered — run a
`grep` sweep in addition for those.

**Use when:** post-rename string-site sweep, auditing `vi.mock` paths,
finding hardcoded URL fragments.

---

### fixture-uses — "where does a name appear in test fixtures?"

```bash
bun run ast-dataflow fixture-uses \
  --needle question_text
```

Scans fixture corpora — JSON fixtures (hand-rolled lexer with key/value +
structural path context), fixture TS files, and markdown frontmatter —
for the needle, classifying each hit as `key` or `value` with its
structural path. Fixture-by-convention: `/fixtures/` path segment or
`*-fixture.ts` basename. Confidence is always `indirect` (fixtures are
data, not type-checked code).

**Use when:** column/field renames that must sweep test data, auditing
which fixtures pin a schema name, pre-migration fixture impact.

---

### column-reads — "every TS file that reads a Supabase column"

```bash
bun run ast-dataflow column-reads \
  --table form_questions --column question_text
```

Walks the TypeScript call graph to find every `.select()` / `.from()` call
chain that references the named table column. Handles aliased column
selects and type-narrowed reads.

**Use when:** pre-column-rename impact, verifying a column migration swept
all read sites, column-access audits.

---

### column-writes — "every TS file that writes a Supabase column"

```bash
bun run ast-dataflow column-writes \
  --table form_questions --column question_text
```

Finds `.insert()`, `.update()`, `.upsert()` call chains writing the named
column. Companion to `column-reads`.

**Use when:** pre-column-rename impact, write-path audits, verifying no
direct writes bypass `sb()` wrappers.

---

### dead-exports — "exports with no non-test callers"

```bash
bun run ast-dataflow dead-exports \
  --scope 'lib/bid/**'
```

Returns exported symbols with zero non-test importers. Each row includes
`testOnly` (true = only referenced from `__tests__/`) and
`reachableImporters` count. Scope is a glob or comma-separated glob list.

**Use when:** pre-delete safety check, dead-code audits, Knip false-positive
confirmation. **Companion:** Pattern 1 (Knip dead-exports verifier).

---

### reexport-chain — "trace the full barrel chain for a symbol"

```bash
bun run ast-dataflow reexport-chain \
  --symbol '@/lib/bid:createBid'
```

Walks re-export declarations from the entry point to the source declaration,
resolving the full chain. Exposes `BARREL_DETECTED` when a symbol escapes
through an index file. Use to confirm Knip false positives caused by barrel
chains.

**Use when:** debugging "why is Knip saying this is dead but it clearly
isn't?", auditing barrel-chain depth, verifying no-barrel-re-exports rule.

---

### type-evolution — "all type-position references for a TypeScript type"

```bash
bun run ast-dataflow type-evolution \
  --type 'types/bid.ts:BidState'
```

Enumerates declaration sites, re-exports, aliases, generic specialisations,
`extends` clauses, conditional types, and mapped-type positions. Returns
rows classified as `typeReference`, `typeOnly`, `read`, or `reexport`.
Gitnexus `impact` covers runtime callers; `type-evolution` covers the type-
position references gitnexus does not index.

**Use when:** pre-type-rename full blast radius, distinguishing runtime
callers (test coverage needed) from type-position references (compile-time
fix only). **Companion:** Pattern 6 (type-evolution agreement check).

---

### enum-uses — "all reads of a specific enum or `as const` member"

```bash
bun run ast-dataflow enum-uses \
  --enum BID_STATES [--member DRAFT]
```

Returns every property-access read, type-position reference, and string-
literal equivalent of the named enum or `as const` member. Handles both
TypeScript `enum` declarations and `as const` object idioms (the KH
convention). Knip has documented false positives on `as const` patterns;
this query provides the semantic confirmation.

**Use when:** auditing before retiring an enum member, confirming a Knip
unused-member report, `as const` property lifecycle audits. **Companion:**
Pattern 8 (Knip enum-member confirmation).

---

### flow-trace — "step-by-step call path from entry to target"

```bash
bun run ast-dataflow flow-trace \
  --entry 'app/api/bid/[id]/route.ts:GET' \
  --target 'lib/supabase/safe.ts:sb'
```

Walks the call graph from an entry point to a target symbol, returning each
hop with its file, line, and hop kind (`call` | `import` | `typeRef`).
Useful for tracing the full execution path of a request through the KH
API layer.

**Use when:** understanding how a request reaches a specific function,
tracing the auth chain, verifying that a write path goes through `sb()`.

---

### type-drift-detect — "API response-interface drift classification"

```bash
bun run ast-dataflow type-drift-detect
```

Classifies every response-interface candidate in the codebase into one of
four buckets: `enforced` (fetcher + route both use it), `fetcher-only`,
`route-only`, or `unused`. Implements PRODUCT.md WP-D (R-WP17). Runs
across the full corpus — no scoping argument needed.

**Use when:** API type-drift audits, enforcing symmetric interface coverage
before an API release, identifying interfaces that have diverged between
fetcher and route definitions.

---

### schema-coverage — "which schema columns are built but never wired?"

```bash
bun run ast-dataflow schema-coverage [--table X] [--report path.md]
```

The headline report query (id-375 A6). Enumerates every table/column from
the generated `database.types.ts`, one-pass-scans the corpus for all
`.from()` chains (including one-hop const-resolved table names), and emits
a per-column verdict: `wired | read-only | write-only | undecidable |
unwired`. Conservative by construction: wildcard/indirect evidence never
counts as wiring; a column is `unwired` only when its table also has zero
smoke; unknown tables/columns are structured errors (`unknown_table` /
`unknown_column`). `--report <path>` additionally writes a Markdown report
(unwired-first, evidence + caveats); no writes without the flag. Full
807-column sweep runs in ~7 s. Blind to: RPC SQL bodies, `api.*` views,
external PostgREST consumers — and the Python pipeline UNLESS you merge
its evidence sidecar: `--evidence <sidecar.json>` (repeatable) folds
external evidence rows into the verdicts. Cross-language verdict recipe:

```bash
bun run ast-dataflow-py schema-uses --exclude-tests > /tmp/py-evidence.json
bun run ast-dataflow schema-coverage --evidence /tmp/py-evidence.json --report out.md
```

Merged sidecars are listed in `caveats.mergedEvidence`; sidecar rows naming
unknown tables/columns land in `caveats.evidenceUnknownTables` (loud, never
dropped). Declaration-only evidence (method `table-schema`) is indirect by
design — it can make a column `undecidable`, never `wired`.

**Use when:** built-not-wired audits, pre-migration column-retirement
candidates, "is anything actually using this table?", owner-facing schema
hygiene reports.

---

## Python corpus sibling (column lineage only)

`bun run ast-dataflow-py column-reads|column-writes --table X --column Y
[--exclude-tests]` (wraps `tools/ast_dataflow_py/cli.py`) answers the same
column question for the Python pipeline corpus (`scripts/`), which reaches the
SAME Postgres tables through THREE surfaces the TS tool cannot see: raw
asyncpg SQL strings, supabase-py `.from_()` chains, and the cocoindex
DECLARATIVE write path (`TableSchema` consts bound by `mount_table_target`,
written via `declare_row` — flow.py's primary write mechanism). Same JSON
envelope; rows carry `source: "sql" | "supabase-py" | "declarative"`.
Declarative semantics: `method: "declare_row"` rows are write evidence
(exact for literal payload keys, incl. the dedup-map `row=<var>` fallback at
indirect); `method: "table-schema"` rows are declaration INTENT only —
always indirect, because flow.py declares columns it deliberately never
populates. SQL statements parse via sqlglot when installed (`exact`
confidence) and degrade to a regex fallback (`indirect`) when not — check
the `sqlglot` boolean in the response. SQL passed by module-constant name
(`conn.fetch(_SQL_FOO)`, the l_records convention) and f-strings over such
constants resolve to their exact text; only locally-assembled SQL stays
invisible (caveated in `schema-uses`).

`bun run ast-dataflow-py schema-uses [--exclude-tests]` is the bulk sweep:
one corpus walk, no --table/--column, emitting every attributable evidence
row as the v1 evidence sidecar (`{schemaVersion, source, rows, caveats}`)
for `schema-coverage --evidence`. Caveats report what was skipped loudly:
rpc payloads (table-blind), unparsed/dynamic SQL, unattributable
declare_row sites. Python symbol queries (callers/references) are
deliberately not duplicated here — use GitNexus (which indexes
`scripts/**.py`) or jedi/pyright.

## Cross-tool patterns

Nine patterns document high-leverage compositions of ast-dataflow with
gitnexus, Knip, and ccc. Full write-up:

| # | Pattern | Tools | Leverage |
|---|---------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Knip dead-exports verifier | `knip --reporter json` + `dead-exports` + `reexport-chain` | High |
| 2 | GitNexus blast radius refinement | `gitnexus_impact` + `callers` / `column-reads` / `references` | High |

## Skill files

Three skills are available. Choose by task shape:

| Task | Skill |
|---|---|
| Verify a rename is complete after `gitnexus_rename` | `ast-dataflow-rename-sweep` |
| Pin the exact call site passing a wrong argument value | `ast-dataflow-call-chain-pin` |
| Orient yourself — which query to use, which pattern to apply | This file (catalogue) |

Full skill paths:

- `.claude/skills/ast-dataflow/ast-dataflow-rename-sweep/SKILL.md` (Pattern 4)
- `.claude/skills/ast-dataflow/ast-dataflow-call-chain-pin/SKILL.md` (Pattern 5)

---

## Error contract

All queries return a `QueryResponse<T>` with a top-level `error` field on
failure:

```typescript
{
  query: string;
  args: Record<string, unknown>;
  error: {
    kind: 'ambiguous_symbol' | 'unknown_file' | 'parse_error' | 'out_of_corpus'
        | 'not_callable' | 'unknown_table' | 'unknown_column';
    message: string;
    hint?: string;
  };
  durationMs: number;
}
```

Common error codes:

| `error.kind` | Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| `ambiguous_symbol` | Symbol name matches multiple declarations | Qualify with `file:symbol` form |
| `unknown_file` | Module path does not exist in the project | Check the path; file may have been renamed |
| `parse_error` | Malformed argument (bad symbol format, empty required arg) | Fix the argument shape shown in the hint |
| `out_of_corpus` | File exists but the named symbol is not declared/exported there | Check the export name; may be default-exported |
| `not_callable` | `callees` target resolves but is not a function | Check the symbol; classes/values have no callees |
| `unknown_table` | `schema-coverage --table` names a table absent from the generated schema | Check `database.types.ts`; table may have been dropped |
| `unknown_column` | `schema-coverage --column` names a column absent from the table | Check the Row type for the table |

A query that runs successfully with zero matches returns `results: []` with
no `error` field — an empty result set is not an error.
